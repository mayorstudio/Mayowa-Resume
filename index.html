    <h1>Mayowa Odunewu</h1> 
    <h3>Art Director | Visual Designer | UI/UX Designer</h3>
    <h2>Summary</h2>  
    <p>I add value to brands through design. These creative graphic
        designs have helped increase client's transactions. <br /> I am result
        oriented and I seek to apply disciplined knowledge gained from years
        of consistent practice, work and <br /> personal attributes of enthusiasm
        into your organization.<br />
        I have an eye for aesthetics. I leverage basic Adobe tools
        (photoshop, illustrator, after effects, premiere pro)<br />and other industry
        standard tools (figma, Blender).
        My core skills are designs of marketing programs<br /> (logos, Posters, corporate identity, branding, web banners, ui/ux design, advertisements and digital media
        marketing).
